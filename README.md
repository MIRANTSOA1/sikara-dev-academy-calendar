# Knowledge requirement for this project

- Loop statement
- Conditional statement (if,else)
- Array manipulation (map,)
- Object manipulation in javascript (create object, get value, etc)
- Template string in javascript

# Project guidelines

## For DOM manipulation

To render node element inside other dom or parent node you can use the following code:

- The HTML element

```html
    <div id="elementId">
         <!-- The html element goes here -->
    </div>
```
- How to select element by id in javascript?

For example to select the element with id=elementId, you can use the following code snippet:

```javascript

let theSelectedElement = document.querySelector('#elementId');

```

- How to add child node inside an other element in the DOM?

For example, you want to render a paragraph inside the html code above,
you can use the following code snippet:

```javascript

const theTextContent = 'Hello world';

theSelectedElement.innerHTML = `<p>${theTextContent}</p>`; // Here we use string template

// So the final result would be (see the next snippet)
```

```html
    <div id="elementId">
         <p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
```

> *Warning:*
> 
> To make sure your js code working after the rendering process in html document, you should wrap your code inside the DOMContentLoaded event handler, see the following code snippet


```javascript

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){
    // your javascript code will be here
})

```
